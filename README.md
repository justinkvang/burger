  ## Installation
  First run `npm i` in order to install the dependencies. The application itself can be invoked with `node server.js` in the intergreated termeinal.

  You must also have [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to run the `schema.sql`. You must create, use, and insert the `burger_db`. 

  (currently not working) Here is a link to the deployed site on [heroku](https://blooming-oasis-28510.herokuapp.com/).

  ## Usage
  When you run `server.js` in the intergrated terminal, it'll log you with a local host. Insert that in your URL and the webpage will show.
